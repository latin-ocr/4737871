STATEMENT ΟΝ ΒυΡιΙΟΑΤΕ iMAGES

This reei of microtiim contains materiai
which has paper color changes, stains, or
illustrations (some of which may appear on
pa9es mixed with printed text). in order to

ensure that aii text and illustrations are ,
temple, exposure settinqs must be changed.

Therefore, when text and illustratione, exist
in a single image or when materiai
bacquounds differ, such frames may need
to be exposed twice.

The first exposure reflects the camera
operator’s best effert to capture the majority
of the text; the second exposure reflects the

camera operator’s best effert to capture

iilustrative materiai or the remaining text. it
is hoped that this practice ννῙΙΙ result in a

microfiim product that fuiiy serves the needs
of most researchers.
